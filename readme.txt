Add some custom blocks for the new WordPress Editor.


== Description ==

OEG Blocks with ACF is a boilerplate of custom blocks for the new editor. They're all made with ACF.


= How-To =

== CSS Customisation ==

These blocks use css tags from Tailwind. Make sure the theme includes it. \

Here are some useful classes to define:

* `[class*=".acf-block--"]`: general rules for all blocks.
* `.acf-block-container.center-max`: **center-max** is used to define a max-width in order to keep the block's content centered on screen.


== To-Do ==

Create more blocks, and look for a way to override some block templates


== Installation ==

* Download the zip archive and upload it to your WordPress site. 
* Activate the plugin, ACF Pro (at least version 5.8) must be activated as well.
* Theme oeglobal should be isntalled. It hasn't being tested with other themes.
* Start using the blocks in any post or page!
